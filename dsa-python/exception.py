# ðŸŒ² In the ancient lands of Syntaxia, a brave function emerged.
#error at compile time and is dealt with removing the errors
#Types of error - 
#1. Syntax error - compile time error, detected by interpreter
#2. Logical/Semantic error - program runs but gives wrong output
#3. Runtime error - program runs but crashes at some point due to some operation
#Exceptions - unexpected events that occur during program execution that disrupt the normal flow of the program
#A special type of runtime error, which is caught and handled, program can keep running after this.
#exception at runtime and could be predicated and handled with exception handling
#common exceptions - ValueError, TypeError, IndexError, KeyError, FileNotFoundError, ImportError, ZeroDivisionError,
#AttributeError, RuntimeError, RecursionError, NameError, MemoryError, EOFError, KeyboardInterrupt, IndentationError,
#AssertionError
#Raise exceptions with raise keyword
#In python - 
#1. try except
#2. try except with else clause, runs if no exception
#3. try except finally, always runs
#4. try except else finally, complete structure
#We can handle different exceptions together or separately with except blocks or use 
#global exception class
# A function wielded the staff of recursion to fetch treasures hidden in distant realms. And thus the prophecy of code lived on.
